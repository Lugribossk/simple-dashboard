A straightforward dashboard for showing an overview of the status of servers and infrastructure.
Runs entirely in the browser as static Javascript so it can be hosted easily without needing to set up and maintain yet another server. 

![Example](/docs/example.jpg)

## Configuration
The dashboard is configured via a JSON config file that defines where to get status information from.

```json
{
    "title": "Infrastructure status",
    "sources": [{
        "type": "statusio",
        "title": "Docker",
        "link": "http://status.docker.com",
        "id": "533c6539221ae15e3f000031"
    }, {
        "type": "rss-aws",
        "title": "CloudFront",
        "id": "cloudfront"
    }, {
        "type": "rss-aws",
        "title": "EC2 US East",
        "id": "ec2-us-east-1"
    }, {
        "type": "dropwizard",
        "title": "Production - Healthcheck",
        "adminPath": "http://localhost:9090/admin"
    }]
}

TODO example.

This is set by many build system that integrate with GitHub such as CircleCI.

## Complications

### Credentials

If you put secrets such as Github tokens in the configuration file, then you should either encrupt the secret or only upload the dashboard to a non-public site.

Values can be encrypted with `window.encrypt("password", "value")` which should then be placed in config.json as e.g. `{"token": {"encrypted": "..."}}`

### Cross-origin requests

TODO


## Setup
- Install NodeJS
- `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- `npm install`

## Development
- `grunt dev`
- Open `localhost:8080`
- The development configuration file will be loaded directly from `src/config.json`

### Adding new source types

1. Create a new subclass of `Source` that overrides `getStatus()`.
2. Define its type in the configuration file by adding it as a static property on your subclass named `type`. 
3. Add it to the list in `SourceTypes`.

## Building
- `grunt build`
- The files in `target/dist` can then be placed on a server. The real config.json configuration file you want to use should be placed next to index.html.

## Docker image
You can run the app hosted in a docker image using `nginx` web server by simply building the image:

`docker build -t simple-dashboard .`

And running it:

`docker run -d --name my-dashboard -p 8080:80 simple-dashboard`

The app will be available on `http://localhost:8080`.
